#\#BKME Android App

###Viva la Veloluci√≥n!

####*An app to faster GET cars invading our bike lanes!*

Very much in development. Uses Phone Gap to interfase HTML5/JS/CSS with native Android Code.

In the html side uses [less](http://lesscss.org) and [Markdotto's preboot.less](http://markdotto.com/bootstrap/) to create the css.
Less and js compiled with [bunch.js](https://github.com/thebarbariangroup/bunch.js)
